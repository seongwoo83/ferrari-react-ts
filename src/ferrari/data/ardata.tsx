The challenging temporary circuit is long-known for giving the drivers of the Challenge championship a particularly tall task, and the opening race of the 2023 visit proved no exception, as drivers contested the elements and over forty fellow competitors in a single thirty-minute contest.^Trofeo Pirelli.* In Trofeo Pirelli, drama struck right from the start as championship leader and pole sitter Matt Kurzejewski (Ferrari of Beverly Hills) lost control of his Ferrari 488 Challenge Evo and speared into the wall on the back straight, bringing out a full course yellow and snapping his winning streak dating back to Circuit of the Americas. From there, it was a dramatic affair in Trofeo Pirelli as Jason McCarthy (Wide World Ferrari) briefly assumed the lead before being tipped into a spin also at the hairpin corner. Ultimately, it was Canadian Martin Burrowes (Ferrari of Quebec) up against Roberto Perrina (Ferrari of Seattle) as the duo scrapped for the final ten minutes of the race, maneuvering around several slower cars along the way. But Burrowes would not be denied, and secured his first home win, ahead of Perrina in second and Carlos De Quesada (Ferrari of Quebec) in third. In the Am category, it was Justin Rothberg (Ferrari of Palm Beach) who continued his momentum from Atlanta with the win, his first at the Canadian circuit, in his first visit as well. He led home Brian Cook (Ferrari of Seattle) and Tony Davis (Continental Autosport) who finished second and third respectively, having also endured a hard fought race. The order left the standings largely unchanged, except of course to give Rothberg a slightly larger margin heading into Sunday’s race.^Coppa Shell.* David Voronin (Foreign Cars Italia) took his third consecutive win in his maiden season of Ferrari Challenge racing, leading championship leader Cameron Root (Ron Tonkin Gran Turismo) in the category while Frank Szczesniak (Ferrari of Austin) rounded out the top three. In the malay of over forty cars on track simultaneously, the Coppa Shell drivers were rapidly separated by cars in other categories, leading to hard fought but ultimately less essential battles as the race ran to its conclusion, though Voronin and Root remained close throughout, separated by just under eight tenths of a second at the checkered flag. Meanwhile in Coppa Shell, Lisa Clark (Ferrari of Beverly Hills) made her return to the top step of the podium after an absence stretching back to the opening round of the season. She led Bruce Cleveland (Ferrari of Silicon Valley) by just half a second at the line, while Paul Lin (Ferrari of Newport Beach) secured the third position a further two seconds down the road.^Schedule.* Ferrari Challenge will return for its final race of the weekend on Sunday at 10:55 a.m. (Eastern time) and the complete race will be available on live.ferrari.com.",

            cont: "Scuderia Ferrari’s qualifying performance did not match the potential shown so far since Friday both in qualfying and race trim. It was a very tricky session on a slippery track with rain falling intermittently at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit. It made it something of a lottery and Charles was unable to progress past Q2. In the final phase, Carlos set the eighth fastest time, but he will line up in eleventh spot on the grid tomorrow as he was given a three place grid penalty for having obstructed Pierre Gasly towards the end of Q1.^Rain and timing.* Carlos and Charles made it through Q1 on Intermediate tyres without much difficulty, as the rain began to fall. In the second part, all the drivers with the exception of Alex Albon decided to go out on new Intermediates as rain was falling again, to bank a time and then switch to Softs. Sainz made the cut to Q3 but Charles had to cut the final chicane and therefore did not improve his time with the Intermediates before the track was wet again. Q3 effectively lasted just a few minutes and Carlos only managed one run as the rain intensified, setting a time of 1’29”294 before Oscar Piastri’s crash brought out the red flags. After the restart, the track was too wet for anyone to improve.^The bit between the teeth.* Carlos and Charles will be looking to fight their way up the order in the race, relying on the pace demonstrated in Friday’s free practice in the dry, battling with what is a very closely matched group behind Max Verstappen. The Grand Prix starts at 14 local (20 CEST).^Carlos Sainz #55*^It was a very tough qualifying. After the incident in FP3 the guys did an amazing job to rebuild the car and I managed to get my confidence back bit by bit in Q1 and Q2, putting some decent laps together.^I was looking forward to pushing hard in Q3, but unfortunately the red flag and later the heavy rain meant we couldn’t improve our time and missed out on a better result. My starting position is not ideal but tomorrow we’ll try our best to make up some places.^Charles Leclerc #16*^I was frustrated after qualifying because I love my team and felt we could all have done a better job today. We have been working so hard and made a good step with the car for this weekend, so it was disappointing not to go through to Q3. We will pull together and work as a team to improve.^I will give everything in the race to make up as many positions as possible and bring home a solid result for us.^Frédéric Vasseur, Team Principal*^Even if the conditions were the same for everyone, for various reasons, qualifying really didn’t go our way today. In Q2, there wasn’t much time to decide on tyre choice and we opted to establish a time on Intermediates before switching to Softs. On the slicks, there was time for just one run before the rain returned and only Carlos managed to improve. In Q3, once again, Carlos could only do one flying lap before the red flag and after that the heavy rain meant it was impossible to improve. From what we saw Friday in free practice and given how evenly matched everyone is, I am confident that, in the race, we can move up the order and bring home a good result.",

Sainz sets a time of 1’20”398, but Charles gets it wrong at the last chicane and fails to improve on Softs before the rain falls again.

The stewards therefore decided to extend the second session from an hour to 90 minutes to allow teams and drivers to make up for lost time. ^77 laps.* Both drivers started off on the same sets of Medium tyres that they had used for just three laps in the first session.

Carlos set a time of 1’13”844 before the red flag and that secured him third place on the time sheet. The threat of rain was increasing at the Gilles Villeneuve Circuit as the session resumed and both Ferraris went out with a heavier fuel load to run in race configuration on both Medium and Hard compound tyres. The rain finally hit the track right at the end of the sessions so that the last few laps were run on Intermediate tyres. Carlos did 39 laps and Charles 38.^Unpredictable weather.* More rain is expected in Montreal tomorrow, but today’s work will still probably be useful for the race, as no rain is forecast at the moment for the Grand Prix.

Racing in support of the Canadian Grand Prix, Ferrari Challenge drivers will have an unmatched experience as hundreds of thousands of fans will descend on the historic circuit for the annual stop. The circuit also offers perhaps the greastest challenge for the drivers in their Ferrari 488 Challenge Evos, as limited track time combined with walls in close proximity will certainly require a careful approach to the limit. Due to the limited space and time, all of the Challenge drivers will race together, rather than being separated between Trofeo Pirelli and Coppa Shell, thus introducing yet another element of uncertainty at the half-way point of the 2023 season.^Trofeo Pirelli.* After a weekend sweep in Road Atlanta, Matt Kurzejewski (Ferrari of Beverly Hills) will lead the Trofeo Pirelli category into Montreal full of momentum, having won the previous three races and four of six in the 2023 Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli season earning 77 points. His victories have put him thirteen points ahead of nearest challenger Jason McCarthy (Wide World Ferrari) who sits on 64 points while Roberto Perrina (Ferrari of Seattle) and Dylan Medler (The Collection) currently share the third spot in the standings on 47 points apiece. In the AM category, Justin Rothberg (Ferrari of Palm Beach) currently leads the standings with a seven point advantage over Tony Davis (Continental Autosport) on 59 to 52 points respectively. The two traded wins at the previous round in Atlanta, but Rothberg’s sweep of pole position and fastest lap in that contest, mixed with a relatively lackluster performance from Davis in race 2 have swung things in the Florida-based driver’s favor. Meanwhile, the duo has a somewhat comfortable lead over Marc Muzzo (Ferrari of Ontario) in third with 36 points after three weekends have been completed. The Am season has been defined by those who have been able to stay out of trouble, with Tony Davis proving the most adept thus far while both Muzzo and Rothberg have suffered 0-point races at one point or another this season.^Coppa Shell.* Cameron Root (Ron Tonkin Gran Turismo) will look to build on his comfortable lead of 18 points in the Coppa Shell championship. In his first ever competitive season, the Oregon-based driver has been a revelation, leveraging consistent podium finishes to build his advantage, mixed with one win at the opening weekend in Homestead. He is chased, however, by David Voronin (Foreign Cars Italia) who hit his stride in Atlanta, securing back to back wins at that demanding circuit. That performance allowed him to leapfrog Sureel Choksi (Ferrari of Denver) who now sits in third, just one point shy of Voronin’s total. In the Am category, its Lisa Clark (Ferrari of Beverly Hills) at the point with 58 points to her name. After an incredible weekend in Homestead, Lisa will look to recapture some of that momentum in Montreal and build a further advantage on Dan Cornish (Ferrari of Austin) who currently sits six points behind in second. Lance Cawley (Ferrari of Atlanta) also made his return to the Coppa Shell AM category in Atlanta, and was immediately a contender, earning his first win of the season and a second place as well to loft himself into contention for the category. ^Schedule.* Official practice sessions will take place on Friday followed by official qualifying sessions on Saturday morning. The first session at 8:15 a.m. (all times Eastern) will set the grid for the first race of the weekend, while the second qualifying session at 10:20 a.m. will set the grid for Sunday’s race. Also note that both races will feature all four categories of Ferrari Challenge races, a necessary outcome considering the tight schedule alongside Formula 1. The first race of the weekend will be at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday while the final race will be at 10:55 a.m. on Sunday. All qualifying and racing action can be watched live on live.ferrari.com.",
